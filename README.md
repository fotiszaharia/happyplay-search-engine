# 🔎 HappyPlay Search

**HappyPlay Search** is a lightweight, Python + Flask-based search engine that lets you browse indexed local content or quickly navigate to any URL.  
It features **dark mode support**, an **About page**, and a clean logo-centered interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 **Search** through locally stored crawled data (`crawled_data.txt`)
- 🔗 **Direct URL redirect** when a full link is entered
- 🌙 **Automatic dark/light mode** based on the user's system settings
- 📄 **About page** (`//about` or `/about`)
- 🎨 **Custom centered logo** for a clean, minimal UI

## 💡 Interesting Thing

There's a special `crawled_data.txt` file containing **all the URLs** the search engine can use.  
This means you can **build your own search system** easily! 🚀  
We’ll also be adding a **special feature soon** — stay tuned. 😉
